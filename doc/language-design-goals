What is SCL trying to describe?

A language for specifying clinical decision support.

What is clinical decision support? Providing timely and helpful best practice advice

How is it provided? Through an intervention mechanism - some way of interrupting a user
  that is about to do something questionable, provide some information about the situation
  and suggest a course of action.

How is it timely? Through clever insertion into the clinical workflow and with the use
  of override reasons which will "lock out" the alert from triggering again for some
  time period.

How is it focused? Through specific interrogation of the patient data and action details
  to determine if the encoded advice is actually applicable.

The best practice will inspect a relevant action occuring in the clinical environment,
  then if the particulars of the situation are a match, it will intervene.

With these things in mind, a compiled SCL program will respond to certain events,
  interrogate available data, and perform some action

INTERVENTION DEFINITION:

type Alert {
  maintext: text
  otherstuff: text
}

given alert1: Alert ← {
  maintext ← "blah blah linebreaks html unicode whatever"
  otherstuff ← "is set here"
}

given complexCondition: Condition ← field operator values
given frequentOverride: Override ← overridetext lockout spec

monitor {
  trigger1 trigger2 trigger3
} when {
  all {
    condition 1
    condition 2
    condition 3 except {
      specific exception
    }
    any {
      option 1
      option 2 except { anotherexception }
      option 3
    } except {
      any {
        exception 1
        exception 2
      }
    }
  } except {
    all {
      exception 1
      exception 1
      exception 1
    }
  } except { exception 1 }
} then {
  show alert1 withOverride {
    "contraindication exists" lockout default
  } withOverride {
    "different contraindication exists" lockout 10 hours
  } withDefaultOverride
}

========================

A set of interventions is defined, thus is the system configured. Trigger events are emitted into
the system, monitoring interventions check their condition sets, upon matching actions are taken
