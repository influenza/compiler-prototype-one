Open question for content building folks: Is your mental model when building a new intervention more like (options follow)
Scott Kubomoto
9:33 PM
ok go for it. shoot.

1. Select a pretty specific set of possible patient data (diagnosis is such and such etc), then remove exception cases (but not X or Y)
2. More traditional logic of "If this and that or those, then ..."
3. Something else entirely
Scott Kubomoto
9:34 PM
you're talking about when we design the logic for an alert, from scratch?
Ronald Dahlgren
9:34 PM
also I see an emerging market in oral hygiene for gophers

right
you have a new guideline or recommendation before you, and you're about to start the process of translating it into something the cms can use
Scott Kubomoto
9:36 PM
I'd say mostly probably 1.
Ronald Dahlgren
9:36 PM
excellent thanks

omg bob
Scott Kubomoto
9:37 PM
I suppose though, that's partly because the CMS intervention editor is set up that way
Ronald Dahlgren
9:38 PM
so I'm interested in the more pure case I guess?
if you could imagine no specific tool existed
I remember spreadsheets back in early 2014 that had "if this then that" sort of logic in them
Scott Kubomoto
9:38 PM
ah right...hmmm
Scott Kubomoto
9:40 PM
Well i think a lot of this is also subtly influenced by the way Epic is set up as well
Ronald Dahlgren
9:40 PM
we've got much more experience with turning content into actionable CDS logic, so I'm just curious about how well the model we chose works
of course
and Cerner has a similar model
and our internal alert engine as well
Scott Kubomoto
9:40 PM
I think the current model makes sense for trying to figure out when an alert should pop-up under which clinical criteria
1. is a bit simpler than 2.
in that sense
Ronald Dahlgren
9:41 PM
right - I can appreciate that. I can almost think of it geometrically as a venn diagram
Scott Kubomoto
9:42 PM
I think it simplifies things a bit to think of "inclusion criteria" and "exclusion" criteria and that probably mirrors the clinical thought process for one specific alert
Ronald Dahlgren
9:42 PM
include this big circle, then subtract these shapes out of it, if the current situation exists in the remaining parts, fire!
Scott Kubomoto
9:42 PM
with a "specific alert" being something that identifies a "specific clinical scenario"
Ronald Dahlgren
9:43 PM
so the really high level place I started from was defining CDS as "providing timely and helpful best practice advice"
Scott Kubomoto
9:43 PM
I think in the long run though if you really want to design more complex CDS you need a different setup
Ronald Dahlgren
9:43 PM
and then I defined some of the ambiguous stuff there and was trying to figure out how best to model the actual particulars of the clinical logic behind the advice
Scott Kubomoto
9:43 PM
for example you could see a world where we build more of a decision tree type of CDS
Ronald Dahlgren
9:43 PM
go on
Ronald Dahlgren
9:45 PM
what we have currently is almost like a decision tree that only contains two leaves - do nothing or fire the specific intervention. You are describing something that might have many interventions existing as leaf nodes on the tree?
Scott Kubomoto
9:45 PM
IF patient has these characteristics and doctor orders X then offer choices 1-5. If doctor answers "yes" to #1 then suggest medication A. If doctor answers yes to #1 then ask questions 6-7......etc
Ronald Dahlgren
9:45 PM
is see - so more flexibility in the actions to take
Scott Kubomoto
9:46 PM
you can see where this would get quite complex quite quickly and the way it's set up right now, we wouldn't be able to design this type of CDS
Ronald Dahlgren
9:46 PM
flexibility and describing an interaction with the provider
Scott Kubomoto
9:46 PM
I think doctors would love this type of CDS.....but the logic is at least 10x more complex than one of our existing single alerts
Ronald Dahlgren
9:47 PM
so in the sample above, maybe the 'had these characteristics' would still be expressed as include/exclude?
then the action path would follow a traditional control flow
Scott Kubomoto
9:48 PM
possibly
medical people like to think of this kind of decision making in terms of a "decision tree"
which simplifies things a bit
Ronald Dahlgren
9:49 PM
so my object-oriented brain is thinking maybe that could be a class of patients. But each CDS piece would likely target a different group right?
^-- still thinking on the 'had these characteristics' part
given that it's by far the most complex piece of our content right now
Scott Kubomoto
9:49 PM
but I don't think decisions in the real world are made in this sort of if then type of branching
Ronald Dahlgren
9:49 PM
hmm
Scott Kubomoto
9:50 PM
what are you trying to make?
Ronald Dahlgren
9:50 PM
I'm sort of prototyping a CDS language
as a fun side project to learn about building compilers ^_^
if it turns out to be something useful, it could someday sit in the middle of the CMS between the UI and the generated artifacts for epic, cerner, etc
Scott Kubomoto
9:51 PM
right
Ronald Dahlgren
9:51 PM
and if not, I've gained some deeper understanding of the class of problems the transformation engine has to address
Scott Kubomoto
9:52 PM
sure, happy to talk more about at a later time. I think it's a whole other discussion about how medical decisions are made, and therefore, whats the best way to either approximate that or augment that
gotta go now though
Ronald Dahlgren
9:52 PM
of course, thank you very much for the insight!
